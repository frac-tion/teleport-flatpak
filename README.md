# teleport-flatpak
Flatpak packages for [Teleport](https://github.com/frac-tion/teleport), an app to simply share files over the local network.

## Install

Teleport should work on all modern GNU/Linux distributions that have a recent version of flatpak, inlcuding Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and others.

If you have GNOME Software (or another GUI app to install flatpaks), just [download this file](http://frac-tion.com/teleport-flatpak/teleport.flatpakref) and open it in Software (your browser should offer to do that before downloading).

Otherwise you can also install it from the command line:
```
flatpak install --from  http://frac-tion.com/teleport-flatpak/teleport.flatpakref
```
